  <span>HISTORY</span>
  <p>Since June 19, 2000, Happy Shop logotype has featured a curved arrow leading from A to Z, representing that the company carries every product from A to Z, with the arrow shaped like a smile.

    According to sources, Happy Shop did not expect to make a profit for four to five years. This comparatively slow growth caused stockholders to complain that the company was not reaching profitability fast enough to justify their investment or even survive in the long term. In 2001, the dot-com bubble burst destroyed many e-companies in the process, but Amazon survived and moved forward beyond the tech crash to become a huge player in online sales. The company finally turned its first profit in the fourth quarter of 2001: $0.01 (i.e., 1¢ per share), on revenues of more than $1 billion. This profit margin, though extremely modest, proved to skeptics that Bezos' unconventional business model could succeed. </p>

  <span>OUR COMMITMENT</span>
  <p>
    Thank you for considering Happy Shop to provide products . Our vision and commitment to our customers is to deliver quality service and personal attention.
